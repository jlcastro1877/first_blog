Page index.html has a logo and a form input
When the submit button is clicked there is a event listening where the data is storaged in the localstorage
I used setattributes in this exercise
When the page blog is loaded there is a function that retrieve data from the localStorage, User name, title and content
on the blog page there is a switcher for light or dark mode and a back button to send the user back to the main page.
