Page index.html has a logo and a form input
When the submit button is clicked there is a event listening where the data is storaged in the localstorage
I used setattributes in this exercise
When the page blog is loaded there is a function that retrieve data from the localStorage, User name, title and content
on the blog page there is a switcher for light or dark mode and a back button to send the user back to the main page.
Each js file, such as blog.js, form.js, have the querySelector to catch the value of each element
Logic js has the functions and calls to execute the logic for Dark mode or locaStorage.
